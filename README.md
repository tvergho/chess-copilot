# Chess Game

## Description
A two-player game of chess, coded in Python. Follows standard chess conventions and rules. At the moment, some features are missing (e.g. castling), and there may be unintended bugs.

This codebase was generated nearly entirely by GitHub Copilot (with some prompting). It is intended as a demonstration of GitHub Copilot's capabilities when provided even minimal human guidance.

The initial prompt provided was "Define a game of chess." The AI then defined the rules, as well as suggesting `arcade` (install using `pip install arcade`) to generate the final output.

## Installation
1. `pip install arcade` (and install python3 and pip if not already installed)
2. `python ./chess.py`
